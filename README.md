* Using Neuron software (http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) for developing a more reliable model for AD disease.

Abstract:

The main objective of this study is to create more realistic biological models of CA1 cells and reanalyze results from previous Alzheimer’s disease-related models. Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most common causes of dementia in older people and there is a huge amount of experimental research data related to it. However, from the theoretical point of view there is still lack of a coherent understanding of its underlying mechanisms. A previous computational model has studied the effects of the progression of Alzheimer’s disease on a CA1 pyramidal neuron model by mimicking this progression through changes in the cell’s intrinsic membrane and synaptic properties and measuring the corresponding changes on the cell’s firing properties (Culmore and Migliore, 2012).However, Culmone and Migliore (2012) did not include dendritic spines in the morphology of their cell model, and there is experimental evidence pointing to a relationship between dendritic spines and Alzheimer’s disease (Smith et al., 2009; Perez-Cruz et al., 2011). Our purpose here will be to use a recent computational model of a CA1 pyramidal cell with dendritic spines (Graham et al., 2014) to redo the study by Culmone and Migliore (2012). To achieve our objectives, we will use the NEURON software. As a result of our study, we expect that the addition of dendritic spines will contribute to the retrieval of the CA1 pyramidal cell functionality because the dendritic spines would enhance optimization of synaptic activity.
